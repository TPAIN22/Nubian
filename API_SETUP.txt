# API Connection Setup for Physical Devices

Your backend server is running on localhost:5000, but physical devices (including iOS) can't access localhost.

## Solution: Set the API URL environment variable

1. Create or edit your .env file in the Nubian directory
2. Add this line:

EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.0.115:5000/api

3. Restart your Expo development server:

npx expo start --tunnel

4. The app should now connect to your backend server.

## Alternative IPs to try (if 192.168.0.115 doesn't work):

- http://192.168.56.1:5000/api
- http://192.168.137.1:5000/api

## Testing:

After setting the environment variable, restart Expo and check that the timeout errors are gone.
